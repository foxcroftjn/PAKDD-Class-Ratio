## Initialize the Python Environment

The python requirements are stored in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Initialize the python environment with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train the Random Forest Classifiers

The notebook [random_forest.ipynb](random_forest.ipynb) generates the random forest models and caches the results.

## Train the Support Vector Classifiers

The notebook [svm_rbf.ipynb](svm_rbf.ipynb) generates support vector classifiers with a radial basis function kernel and caches the results. These are the SVM results published in the paper.

The notebook [svm_linear.ipynb](svm_linear.ipynb) generates support vector classifiers with a linear kernel and caches the results.
